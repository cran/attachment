Description: Tools to help manage dependencies during package
    development.  This can retrieve all dependencies that are used in R
    files in the "R" directory, in Rmd files in "vignettes" directory and
    in 'roxygen2' documentation of functions. There is a function to
    update the Description file of your package and a function to create a
    file with the R commands to install all dependencies of your package.
    All functions to retrieve dependencies of R scripts and Rmd files can
    be used independently of a package development.
